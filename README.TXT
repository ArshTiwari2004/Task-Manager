I have developed a rudimentary project titled 'TASK MANAGER' using a technology stack comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to dynamically add and remove tasks, providing a basic yet functional task management interface. This project serves as an entry-level demonstration of web development skills, showcasing basic proficiency in front-end technologies for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.
